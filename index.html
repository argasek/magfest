            <div>
              <p>Short for "Music And Gaming Festival," MAGFest is a four day-long event dedicated to the appreciation of video game music, gaming of all types, and the gaming community.</p>
              <p>The event runs 24 hours a day, and offers consoles, arcades, tabletop, LAN, live video game cover bands, chiptunes, vendors, guest speakers, and much much more.</p>

            <p class="lead font-weight-normal">It's a community. Cool one!</p>
            <p>The demoscene is an international computer art subculture focused on producing demos: self-contained, sometimes extremely small, computer programs that produce audio-visual presentations.</p>
            <p>The purpose of a demo is to show off programming, visual art, and musical skills. Demos and other demoscene productions are shared at festivals known as demoparties, voted on by those who attend, and released online.</p>

              <p>A demoparty is an event that gathers demosceners and other computer enthusiasts to partake in competitions called Compos.</p>
              <p>A typical demoparty is a non-stop event spanning a weekend, providing the visitors a lot of time to socialize. The competing works, at least those in the most important competitions, are usually shown at night, using a video projector and loudspeakers.</p>

            <h3 class="display-5 font-weight-normal">Why MAGFest Demoparty?</h3>
            <p class="lead font-weight-normal">Because MAGFest and Demoscene play really well.</p>
            <div>
              <p>
                Demoscene and demoparties, while present in the US, remained so far mostly a european phenomenon. One of the important factors,
                which makes integration of the demosceners in US difficult, is that demoparties here don't run 24h/day for 3 days. MAGFest does! Moreover,
                it offers a tons of other attractions: computer museum, gigs, discussion panels, video-game competitions, jam sessions, cosplays — you name it!
              </p>
              <p>
                MAGFest is also full of young, talented people. In 2016, we started with just a presentation panel on the Demoscene; year later, Maq/Floppy
                run a workshop on shader programming, followed by two <a href="https://www.pouet.net/party.php?which=1830&when=2018">shader competitions</a>,
                where several people participated in the demoscene competition for the first time in their lives! We believe we can attract even more demosceners
                this year.

            <p>No copy – be original! Only new entries, not submitted anywhere else (this includes making them public / available on the Internet).</p>

            <p>We reserve the right to reject / remove any entries which do not follow the rules or are not demoscene related.</p>
            <p>
              If your prod violates any US or international law, is considered offensive or inappropriate, we can disqualify it or exclude it from post-party submission to demoscene archives.

            <p class="lead font-weight-normal">We have four. Maybe more.</p>

            <p>You can submit your entries in the following categories:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>demo / intro compo</li>

              <li>wild / animation</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We will be flexible with compos if they are very popular (separating different kinds of music tracker formats if needed, etc.), all to make the competitions more exciting. As this is a multiplatform party, any demoscene hardware is welcome.</p>
